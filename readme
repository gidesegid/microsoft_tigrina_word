# Writing Tigrinya

**Writing Tigrinya** is a desktop application designed to help users write, edit, and format text in the **Tigrinya language** easily.  
The application aims to provide a **Tigrinya-centered alternative to Microsoft Word**, making digital writing more accessible for Tigrinya speakers.
